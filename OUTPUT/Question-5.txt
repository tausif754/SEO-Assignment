Answer:- A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square
image or icon associated with a website. Favicons are displayed in various
places, such as the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other places
where the website is referenced. They serve as a visual representation of the
website and are often used for branding and easy identification.
